# Currency Converter API
This is a simple currency converter API in Node.js

## Description

This application allows you to convert currencies using the latest exchange rates. It fetches the exchange rates from a third-party [Monobank Public API](https://api.monobank.ua/docs/) and performs currency conversion.
It also utilizes Redis to cache the currency rates for 1 hour.

## Installation
Make sure you have Node.js and Redis is installed on your machine. Redis should be running on the default port 6379.

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration
You can configure the app by copying variables from the .env.sample file to .env file.

## Running the app

```bash
    nodemon app.js
```

Your app should now be running on localhost:3000.

## Docker

```bash
    docker-compose up
```
